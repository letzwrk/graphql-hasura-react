I became driven to amass blue collar skill and knowledge after learning the growing gab of skilled labor vs the supply. 

A large portion of the skilled labor in the current workforce will be retired in the next 5-10 years yet a small portion of that will be replaced  and with far less skill. 

The amount of homes needing to be built just to meet the demand of this current generation starting a family will not be met and was needed to add 1 million homes in the next 2 years. 

This doesn't cover the demand for repairing or installing in the homes and aparments currently occupied. 

America we have a problem. These labor shortages are problems that we need to solve.
